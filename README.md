# traversing-graphs
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. Graphs are one of the most commonly asked topics in programming competitions. They have extensive real world applications.
In this repository, I have outlined two ways to traverse graphs using Breadth First Search(BFS), and Depth First Search(DFS). I have also solved Codeforces problem 1167 C using DFS.
